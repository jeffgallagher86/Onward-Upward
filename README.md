# Design Choices

### Colour Scheme

My aim with the colour scheme of the site was for the aesthetic to reflect the natural and healthy food which we are promoting. The green tones are associated with health, tranquility, power and nature. Greens are used to relax customers and promote environmental issues. 

The colour green stimulates harmony in your brain and encourages a balance leading to decisiveness. The Orange tones are to encourage feelings of joy, warmth, heat, sunshine, enthusiasm, health, stimulation and happiness.

My overall aim with the colour scheme of the site is to create an autumnal feel the aim being to comfort the user with a warm sense of familiarity. The images i have used were chosen to work in harmony with the overrall colour scheme.

Colour scheme was used courtesy of the [Hook Agency](https://hookagency.com/).

### Typography

The fonts i have used were chosen to both eye catching and funtional. I think the PT Sans Narrow font adds and hint of pizzazz to the site with Open Sans a much more funtional counterbalance.

[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/): PT Sans Narrow & Open Sans

## Wireframes 

Here are my original wireframe mockups.

* [Balsamiq Wireframes PDF](https://github.com/jeffgallagher86/milestone-project-1/blob/master/assets/Docs/Milestone%201%20Large%20screen.pdf)


I like to think i havent diverted too musch from my original idea for the site(aside from the various title changes). 

* I had originally planned to have a carousel for my landing page but i found it to look outdated so i switched that out for the landing page with the gradient and text overlay or a more modern look and i am pleased with the result.

* On the individual recipe page i have added a related recipe section on reccomendation from my mentor Akshat Garg, this was great advice which and something i should have thought of originally.about-me

* I think i have stayed true to my orginal idea with the look being similar across all screen resolutions.

## Mobile First Design

* While building this site as the focus with bootstrap is a mobile first approach i was conscious of my page looking responsive across a variety of media devices. This was something i was extremely vigilent with. 

There were issues with the heading overlay on the hero image outsizing the screen resolution when switched to landscap mode on some of the smaller mobile devices. I remedied this with Media Queries as shown below.

---

@media screen and (max-width: 800px) and (max-height: 450px) {
    .hero-img-inner h1 {
        font-size: 50px;
    }

    .hero-subheading {
        margin: 10px;
        font-size: 20px;
    }
}

@media screen and (max-width: 430px) and (max-height: 645px) {
    .hero-img-inner h1 {
        font-size: 50px;
    }

    .hero-subheading {
        margin: 10px;
        font-size: 20px;
    }
}

---

* There were also issues with the recipe thumbnails being too large for landscape mode on mobile devices. I tried to remedy this by reducing the cols but this made the columns un even and only one thumbnail wrapped below the other three on top. I then fixed this by including a column break so that two thumbnails would show above and below. I did this with the below code:

`<div class="w-100 d-none d-sm-block d-lg-none"></div>`

# Testing

## Code Validation

I used W3 Schools code validators for the HTML and CSS, there are no errors in the HTML. 

There are errors in the CSS which can be attributed to the boostrap used on the site. There was one error in the CSS i had written.

`.social-links {
    text-align: "center";
}`

I have remedied this by removing the quotation marks around center, as follows:

`.social-links {
    text-align: center;
}`

## Lighthouse and WAVE Web Accessibility Reports

* I am happy with the results of my lighthouse accessibilty reports for both Desktop and Mobile resapectively below, the only real issues i have come accross here are the colour contrast issues on the site, i weighed up the pros and cons of switching the colours, but i have decided to stick with my guns and not compromise on the aesthetic of the site.

![Lighthouse Desktop Report](assets/docs/lighthouse_desktop_report.jpg "Lighthouse Desktop Report")

![Lighthouse Mobile Report](assets/docs/lighthouse_mobile_report.jpg "Lighthouse Mobile Report")

* The only error in my WAVE report(aside from the contrast issues) was due to an ampty form label in my sign up section, i have sing removed this as i found it more visually pleasing and just as effective to use the placeholder text as an instruction for the Email Sign-up.

* I also conducted a Web Page Performance test. I was pleased with the results noting that website security is something i need to look into going forward.
